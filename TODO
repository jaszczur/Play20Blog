Backlog / ideas:
 * use twitter bootstrap to enhance gui
 * add date field to BlogEntry
 * add location field to BlogEntry and use html5 geolocation to set it
 * add "user location" widget to share user location name (google maps reverse geocoding). when site owner has a page opened it will send his/her location to the server
