Backlog / ideas:
 * publish blog entries to various services (twitter, facebook, g+, ...)
 * "user location" widget to share user location name (google maps reverse geocoding). when site owner has a page opened it will send his/her location to the server

Done:
 * use twitter bootstrap to enhance gui
 * date field to BlogEntry
 * location field to BlogEntry and use html5 geolocation to set it
